# Hotel Management Microservices

Welcome to the Hotel Management Microservices project! This project is designed to demonstrate a microservices architecture for managing a hotel reservation system. The project consists of multiple microservices that work together to provide various functionalities related to hotel management.

## Microservices

The project includes the following microservices:

1. **UserService**: Manages user registration and authentication.

2. **RatingService**: Handles hotel rating and feedback from users.

3. **HotelService**: Manages hotel information, reservations, and availability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Spring Tool Suite (STS)](https://spring.io/tools) or your preferred IDE
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Arup-Sarkar-24/MicroSevicesDemo.git
   ```

2. Open each microservice project in your preferred IDE (STS recommended).

3. Configure your database settings and application properties for each microservice. 

4. Build and run each microservice.

5. Use [Eureka Server](https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/) for service registration and discovery. Make sure Eureka Server is running.

6. Access the microservices through the Eureka Server to interact with the system.

### Usage

Provide examples or details on how to use each microservice. Include API endpoints, request payloads, and expected responses.

### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer containerization, you can use Docker to containerize each microservice. Dockerfiles and docker-compose files are provided in the respective microservice folders.

### Testing

Explain how to run the tests for the microservices.
